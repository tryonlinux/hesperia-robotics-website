Signing up for GitHub is super easy.

1. Follow this <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home" target="_blank">Link</a> 
2. Type in a unique username, this will be used everywhere on GitHub and will practically be what you are known by, so choose carefully. Mine is tryonlinux.
3. Type in an email address and a very strong password. You don't want someone to steal your account and take over your code. 
4. Simply verify and click create Account and follow the instructions.
