To explain GitHub, it is first important to understand what git is:

Git is a program used to keep track of code changes, this is called A Version Control System. We use this program as a way of breaking our different versions of our code up to keep track of what we changed. This is important as you make multiple changes to your code, it sometimes helps to look back at a previous change or even revert back to a previous version of your code. 

Github on the other hand is a free (with paid options to enhance) source code repository for the git program. As a repository, it allows us to upload our code to the GitHub servers/website for saving/backing up, sharing and collaboration. You will learn more about this in the coming sections. 

GitHub breaks our projects into things called repositories, and we use git to update our code inside of these repositories where we can choose to share and let others update our code or keep it to ourselves as a means of a backup and version control.  

GitHub and git are very powerful tool, and have many features that we won't cover early on in this course, so feel free to play around with it and learn.
