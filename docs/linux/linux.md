Linux is a free and open source Operating System that was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in the 1990's as a clone of a popular paid and closed source operating system called Unix. However since then it is developed and maintained by countless software developers and others who have built it into the famous and fabulous piece of technology it is today. Today it is commonly referred as Linux/GNU, as Linux is an Operating System, with various software that runs on it such as word processors and internet browsers. Linux is even at the core of popular devices such as Android Phones and is the default supported Operating System for the Raspberry Pi.

#### What is an Operating System?

An Operating System is the core of the software that manages the CPU, Memory, and other hardware devices. It is commonly called the Kernel in regards to Linux. Linux enables Hardware and Software to talk to each other, it is essentially the brain. This is a very basic explanation of Linux.

The best part of Linux is that anyone can change it to fit their needs as well as get it for free. 

#### Linux/GNU?

So now that you know what Linux, what does the GNU mean? GNU is the name of a movement that inspired millions of people to share code freely and work together to build tons of software, it is joined by countless other movements with varying rules on how to share. These communities have built tons of different software applications that you will see on your Raspberry Pi, throughout this course, and all over the internet. Their code is the backbone to software you probably use today such as Google Chrome, FireFox, Android Phones, games you play, your devices such as gaming consoles and tv recorders, and even our cars. GNU software is typically even free as in cost, in addition to free to modify and change to fit your needs. 


#### Compared to Windows or Mac

To compare this to Windows or Mac, you can think of Linux as Windows or Mac itself and the software that runs on top of it such as Word, Excel, iTunes, etc as the GNU part. However, some, if not most of the software that comes built in with Windows/Mac, including the Operating System itself is not modifiable to fit our needs and the source code is not something we can change. Thanks to GNU and other such movements, this is beginning to change each day as Microsoft and Apple open source their software to the public.
