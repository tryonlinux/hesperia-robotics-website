The Hardware we will be using at the core is a Raspberry Pi, a Laptop, and various small electrical components. 

Each section will start with a parts list that highlights what parts you need to complete all the subsections. Most of this hardware can be purchased on sites like <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/" target="_blank">Adafruit</a>, <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/" target="_blank">SparkFun</a>, <a href="https://www.element14.com/" target="_blank">Element14</a>, <a href="https://www.jameco.com/" target="_blank">Jameco</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, etc. It is best to shop around for the best deals and shipping times (i.e. a lot of parts on eBay are cheap, but have 6-8 week lead times as they are shipping from China). If you are under 18, please work with your club leaders or an adult for assistance. 

One thing we will not go over, but is expected: **Have access to a Wi-Fi router and the internet that you can connect your hardware to.**
