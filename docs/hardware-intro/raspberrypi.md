## What is a Raspberry Pi?
A Raspberry Pi (pi) is a small credit card sized computer system (Think of a really small computer Tower). This small computer is powerful, it can run Web Browsers, Word Processors/Office Software, Games, Write Software, etc. However the thing that catches our attention the most for use in robotics is it's GPIO - General Purpose Input Output Pins that are shown below. These pins give us direct access to control real world devices such as LEDs, Motors, Relays, and all sorts of other hardware components. These are great for controlling various parts of a robot or other projects. We also  of course have the normal hardware input/outputs such as Speakers, Microphones, Web Cams, etc that allow us to enable the pi to see, hear, and talk, leading to many opportunities. Even includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for connecting to the world and other devices such as PlayStation/Xbox Controllers and phones. 

All that and it is super cheap! You can buy it typically for $25-50 USD, or a full kit for around $95 USD. 

The pi runs a free and open-source powerful and customizable operating system called Linux/GNU. This operating system typically isn't know to the masses but runs many devices you have come to love today behind the scenes. We have an entire section dedicated to it later to familiarize you with how it works.
